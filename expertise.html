                <h3 class="font-semibold">PHP, Laravel</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-500">
                    We use PHP for server side/backend services. PHP is the most popular language for building web application.
                    Our tech stack is wrapped around PHP and Laravel. Laravel is most loved and battle tested backend PHP framework.
                    Laravel is famous for its elegant code readability, simplicity, maintainability. We have been working with this
                    framework for years and developed more than hundreds of web applications/APIs using it. Be sure you are dealing
                    with the people who know their tools well. For clients who are not interested using separate frontend application,
                    we use <a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/">Livewire</a> or <a href="https://inertiajs.com">InertiaJS</a>
                    for such websites.

                <h3 class="font-semibold">VueJS</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-500">
                    Fastest growing frontend JS framework. We use this to build interactive frontend application. As VueJS do two-way
                    data binding like AngularJs and ReactJS, it's much more convenient to make the interface highly interactive to the users.

                <h3 class="font-semibold">Tailwind CSS</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-500">
                    The frontend CSS framework sometimes depends on our client's preferred design template. Other than that, Tailwind CSS
                    is our goto CSS framework. Tailwind CSS comes with utility libraries which give us the control of designing any
                    component in our own way. Both Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap is very powerful building responsive web design.

                <h3 class="font-semibold">MySQL</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-500">
                    MySQL database management system is one of the most popular and powerful database system. We prefer MySQL in most cases
                    due to its being a relational database system and its being free. Other than that, as different database engines of MySQL
                    support's database transaction, trigger, foreign key constrain we try to make use of these feature whenever needed.

                <p class="text-gray-500">
                    From our experience we have seen that many of our clients struggle to manage their own server. So, we also offer managing
                    server for our clients. Ideally, we suggest Virtual Private Server(VPS) as it's more convenient to install all necessary
                    libraries and packages that is required to install the web application. We have hands on experience of managing cloud services like
                    Amazon Web Service(AWS), Digital Ocean etc.
